Implementations of IETF-RFC 3852

This is an update from previous project, DetachedSignature.

Now covers broader implementation of IET-RFC 3852 about Cryptographically Message Syntax (CMS), namely Signed-data, Enveloped-data, Digested-data, Encrypted-data, and Authenticated-data content type.

Currently only Signed-data and Enveloped-data are accomodated. Hopefully I could create more implementations in the future.
